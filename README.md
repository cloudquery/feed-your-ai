# CloudQuery AI Pipeline Demo

Transform your AWS infrastructure into AI-ready insights with CloudQuery, PostgreSQL, and pgvector. This demo showcases how to build AI/ML pipelines on clean cloud infrastructure data.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- AWS CLI configured (optional - demo works with sample data)

### Get Running in 2 Steps

```bash
# 1. Make scripts executable and run setup
chmod +x *.sh
./setup.sh

# 2. Run the interactive demo
./demo.sh
```

That's it! The setup script will automatically:

- Install CloudQuery CLI
- Start PostgreSQL with pgvector extension
- Load sample AWS infrastructure data
- Verify everything is working

## üéØ What This Demo Shows

This demo creates a complete AI pipeline that:

1. **Extracts AWS infrastructure data** using CloudQuery
2. **Stores data in PostgreSQL** with pgvector for AI capabilities
3. **Generates vector embeddings** from infrastructure configurations
4. **Performs AI-powered analysis** including similarity search and clustering
5. **Provides actionable insights** for cost optimization and standardization

## üõ†Ô∏è Utility Scripts

- **`setup.sh`** - Full automated setup (start here!)
- **`quickstart.sh`** - Quick infrastructure start for existing installations
- **`cleanup.sh`** - Reset environment for fresh start
- **`healthcheck.sh`** - Diagnose any issues
- **`demo.sh`** - Interactive demo with explanations
